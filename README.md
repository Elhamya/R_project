# R_project
Exploring and visualizing gapminder dataset which is tracking economic and social indicators, with R programing language, this project going to introduce tidyverse a powerful and popular approach for exploring data
Using R to draw conclusions about the social and economic history of countries around the world. 
the specific insights will be communicated through informative visualizzations with the ggplot2 package
a dataframe keeps rectangular data in rows and columns, similar to spread sheets or tables in sql database
(gapminder> tibble> special type of data frame)
a tibble: 1704x 6 > 1704 rows each of which we call an observation, it has 6 columns each of which we call variables
It's important in analysis to understand what each observation represants, here each represents a unique pair of a country and a year. for each combination of a country and year the dataset contains several variables, or columns, describing the country demographics
each variable is of one consistant data type
